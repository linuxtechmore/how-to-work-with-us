# how-to-work-with-us
As a project covering Linux and open source ecosystems, we welcome your contribution, which is not limited to the financial aspect only, as you can contribute to the development of the project by:

- Report a bug/error in our website, articles, or repositories.
- Share our works to spread the benefit.
- Join us on social media.
- If you have programming experience, you can become a member of our project (developing apps, fixing bugs, designing templates, themes, icons, etc.).
- Submits tips, news, and article ideas.
- Making tutorials about Linux software and distributions.
- Providing Linux-specific products for reviewing purposes or developing the project's infrastructure.
- Finally, you can also contribute financially to develop the project and maintain its continuity: your contributions will help us to migrate our website to a better hosting service, provide equipment to produce high-quality streams and video tutorials, develop equipment used in programming and video editing, provide income for members that allows them to devote more time to the project, hire developers to develop open source software, etc.

I have tried to make this code of conduct as brief and understandable as possible. If you need more details, you can contact us via email: contact@linuxtechmore.com.
